<h2>Background</h2>
After spending weeks developing my software engineering skills, I decided to give myself a reward by going to the cinema to see a movie. Skimming through the list of available movies, I was at lost at which of them to watch due to not enough information available of the board. To solve this problem for other users, I created a movie app to furnish movie lovers with quick information about their favourite movies. Information such as the year of production, plot, actors and the box office grossing would be available for users to make a choice.

This project fetches data from the popular ombd API and inserts it into our app for a seamless user experience.

We have used DOM manipulation in serving data to our movieva APP.
